   > For each future stage, I will list the newly required software. 
   
## Using an IDE

I recommend that you work with your Java code using an IDE that supports the development of Spring Boot applications such as Spring Tool Suite or IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition. So you can use the Spring Boot Dashboard to run the services, run each microservice test case, and many more.

All that you want to do is just fire up your IDE **->** open or import the parent folder `ecommerce-microservice-backend-app`, and everything will be ready for you.
